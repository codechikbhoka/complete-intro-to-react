// On top of Prettier which takes of all the formatting, you may want to enforce some code 
// styles which pertain more to usage: for example you may want to force people never use with 
// which is valid JS but illadvised to use. ESLint comes into play here. It will lint for this 
// problems. There are dozens of present configs for ESLint and you're welcome to use any one of them. 
// The Airbnb config is very popular, as is the standard config (which I teach in previous versions 
// of this class.) We're going to use the Airbnb one since it's likely the most popular one. Let's 
// create an .eslintrc.json file to start linting our project.
